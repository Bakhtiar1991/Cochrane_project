Performed end to end automation testing on login option using page object model. Generated an html report using mochawesome. 

- Go to cypress/e2e/login_test.cy.js to find the test suit. I have written 3 negetive test where I provided wrong credential and then click on the my profile button and it fails. On last test with right username and right password it passed to click on the my profile button.

- Go to cypress/e2e/pages/login_page.js to find LoginPage class.

- Go to cypress/videos to find the video of the test suit.

- Go to cypress/reports to find the html report file including assets.
